# tts-emotion

OVERVIEW

A common problem with AI voiceovers involves its lack of realism, especially that it lacks emotion and is usually monotonous. This project attempts to improve the functionality of text-to-speech (TTS) of AI voices through finetuning existing TTS models to better capture human emotion in the voices, creating a more realistic and immersive AI audio experience.
